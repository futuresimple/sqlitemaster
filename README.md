DEPRECATED
==========
This library was incorporated into [android-schema-utils](https://github.com/futuresimple/android-schema-utils) library.

SQLiteMaster
============
Android library for getting existing db schema information from sqlite_master table.

Basic usage
-----------
You can use the schema information in your SQLiteOpenHelper's `onCreate` and `onUpgrade` to remove some boilerplate code. Compare:

```java
db.execSQL("DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_a");
db.execSQL("DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_b");
db.execSQL("DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_c");
// ...
db.execSQL("DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_z");
```

With:
```java
SQLiteMaster.dropTriggers(db);
```

You can perform similar operations with views, tables and indexes, or you can access the full schema information using `getSQLiteSchemaParts(SQLiteDatabase db, SQLiteSchemaPartType partType)` or `getSQLiteSchemaParts(SQLiteDatabase db)`, which return the list of `SQLiteSchemaPart` objects:

```java
public class SQLiteSchemaPart {
  public final String name;
  public final String sql;
  public final String type;
}
```

What you do with that information is completely up to you.

Building
--------
This is standard maven project. To build it just execute:
```shell
mvn clean package
```
in directory with pom.xml.

Is it safe to use?
------------------
Our tests indicate that there are no issues whatsoever on API level 8+ (Android 2.2). We haven't tested earlier versions, so consider yourself warned (and please let us know if you confirm it works on lower API levels!).
